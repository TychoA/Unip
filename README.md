# Unip
Small and simple library for unit testing in php7.

## Philosophy
It is build around the idea of having a easy way to manage unit tests. 
And horizontal inheritance of assertion functionality, which can be
integrated into test cases.

## Future
This is just a incredibly simple, and possible naive implementation. Meant as
a learning/hobby experiment.

Might add more to it in the future.
